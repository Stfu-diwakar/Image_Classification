This project implements a CNN-based image classification system using the Cats vs Dogs dataset.
Images were resized, normalized, and augmented before training.
A convolutional neural network was built using TensorFlow.
The model was trained and evaluated using accuracy metrics.
The trained model was deployed as a web application using Streamlit.
This project demonstrates both machine learning and deployment skills.
