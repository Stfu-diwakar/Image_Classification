# 🐱🐶 Cats vs Dogs Image Classification using CNN

This project implements a **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)** to classify images as **Cat** or **Dog**.  
The model is trained using **TensorFlow (Keras)** and deployed as a **web application using Streamlit**.

Due to GitHub file size limitations, the trained model is hosted on **Google Drive** and downloaded dynamically at runtime.
